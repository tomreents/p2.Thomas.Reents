For dashboards 1, 2, and 3, I like the simplicity of their designs. However, I do not think the RPM gauge should be as large as the MPH gauge. Most people do not keep a close eye on their RPM's while driving, but they watch their MPH, so I Think the speedometer should be the main focus. Also, for 2 and 3, I like that they show a number for the MPH and RPM instead of just the dial. But if they are going to display an actual number, there is no point in still having the dial. For 3, it shows what gear you are in, but it does not show where you are in relation to the other gears like 5 does, I think this could cause problems when trying to switch gears. For 4 and 5, I like how the MPH is the center of the design. I do not like how dashboard 4 does not have an indicator to show what gear you are in, this is a major design flaw. I think 5 is a good design, the indication of north, south, east, and west is a nice touch. there is however a lot of different page options and it seems they probably would not get used that much.
